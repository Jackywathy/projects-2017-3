/*
This file should have all the styles that should be the same on every page

This includes (but is not limited to):
- h1
- a
- body
- fieldset
- label

HINTS
- There should be no references to classes in base.css, only element selectors
- When you add a style to base.css you should delete it from any other files

CHECK YOUR WORK
When you are done updating base.css there should be no CSS rules in
any other file that reference an element directly as the top selector.

For example:

- Not ok (in other files, this syle is correct ONLY for base.css)
  a {
    color: blue;
  }

- Should be
  .post a {
    color: blue;
  }
